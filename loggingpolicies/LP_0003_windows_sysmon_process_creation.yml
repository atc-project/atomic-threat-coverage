  The process creation event provides extended information 
  about a newly created process. The full command line provides 
  context on the process execution. The ProcessGUID field is a 
  unique value for this process across a domain to make event 
  correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of the file with 
  the algorithms in the HashType field.
