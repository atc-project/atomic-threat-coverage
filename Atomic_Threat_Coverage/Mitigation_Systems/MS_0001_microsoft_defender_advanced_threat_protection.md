- Endpoint detection and response: Endpoint detection and response capabilities are put in place to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats that may have made it past the first two security pillars
- Automated investigation and remediation: In conjunction with being able to quickly respond to advanced attacks, Microsoft Defender ATP offers automatic investigation and remediation capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale
- Secure score: This capability helps to dynamically assess the security state of enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security of an organization
- Microsoft Threat Experts: Microsoft Defender ATP's new managed threat hunting service provides proactive hunting, prioritization and additional context and insights that further empower Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to identify and respond to threats quickly and accurately
