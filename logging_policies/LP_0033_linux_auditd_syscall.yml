  Command to log kill syscall for x64 CPU architecture:
  
  ```
  auditctl -a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S kill
  ```

  You can configure variety of [syscalls](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/).
  If the system is 32 bit OS, you need to set it with "arch=b32".

  To permanently implement auditd rules, edit `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file:

  ```
  -a exit,always -F arch=b64 -S kill -k kill_signal
  ```

  Command to enable rules (execute as root):

  ```
  augenrules --load
  ```
