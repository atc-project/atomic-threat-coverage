description: >
  Module logging records pipeline execution details as PowerShell executes, 
  including variable initialization and command invocations. 
  Module logging will record portions of scripts, some de-obfuscated code, 
  and some data formatted for output. 
  This logging will capture some details missed by other PowerShell logging sources, 
  though it may not reliably capture the commands executed
