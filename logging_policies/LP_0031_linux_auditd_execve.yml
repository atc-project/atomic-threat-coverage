configuration: |
  Command to log the execve system call:
  
  ```
  auditctl -a exit,always -S execve
  ```

  Command to enable logging of specific executable invocation:

  ```
  auditctl -a exit,always -S execve -F path=/usr/bin/rrdtool
  ```

  To permanently implement auditd rules, edit `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file:

  ```
  -a exit,always -S execve                           # log everything
  ```

  Command to enable rules (execute as root):

  ```
  augenrules --load
  ```
