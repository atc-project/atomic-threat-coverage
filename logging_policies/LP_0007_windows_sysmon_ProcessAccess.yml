default: Not configured
volume: High
description: >
  The process accessed event reports when a process opens another process, 
  an operation that’s often followed by information queries or reading and writing the address 
  space of the target process. This enables detection of hacking tools that read the memory 
  contents of processes like Local Security Authority (Lsass.exe) in order to steal credentials for use in Pass-the-Hash 
  attacks. Enabling it can generate significant amounts of logging if there are diagnostic utilities active 
  that repeatedly open processes to query their state, so it generally should only be done so with filters 
  that remove expected accesses.
eventID:

configuration: |
  Sysmon event id 10 is disabled by default. 
  It can be enabled by specyfying configuration
  However due to high level of produced logs it should be filtred with configuration file
  Sample configuration:
  ```
    <ProcessAccess onmatch="include">
      <TargetImage condition="is">C:\Windows\system32\lsass.exe</TargetImage>
    </ProcessAccess>
    <ProcessAccess onmatch="exclude">
      <SourceImage condition="is">C:\windows\system32\wbem\wmiprvse.exe</SourceImage>
      <SourceImage condition="is">C:\windows\system32\svchost.exe</SourceImage>
    </ProcessAccess>
  ```
